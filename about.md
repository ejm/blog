Hi, I'm Evan Markowitz, and I do things on the internet.  I write code, particularly in Python with some Java mixed in, but I also fix compters and I intend on building my own in the near future (check out the blog for news on that!)

I'm enthusiastic, fun-loving, and I love to try out new stuff.  One of those new things was to fix up my website.  My posts generally cater to those who enjoy technology; my username isn't techkid6 for nothing.

You can find me on all of these places:

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/techkid6)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/techkid6)
* [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+EvanMarkowitz)

And you can follow this blog [here](http://techkid6.com/feed.xml)
